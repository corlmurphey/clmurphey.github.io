<h2 id="growth">Growth</h2>
<p>As a classical singer, vocal polyp growth is a frightening yet all too real risk of my hobby. Vocal polyps grow when the vocal folds beat as a result of extensive abuse of the vocal folds, such as by yelling, singing, or talking loudly and for extending periods of time. I developed a model of vocal polyp growth, predicting the magnitude of forces and duration of time required to cause initial polyp growth. Once a polyp begins to grow, polyps grow exponentially due to larger surface area interfering with the natural motion of the vocal folds.</p>

<p>Years later I revisited vocal fold modeling to look at vocal fold motion. For this project, I studied 1-dimensional motion of the vocal folds in the transverse plane of the larynx. Building on existing models that examine motion in the frontal plane of the body, this model provides a different perspective on vocal fold motion crucial for building patient-specific diagnostic tool.  The Symmetric and Asymmetric Motion videos below are described by 1D equations of motion and solved by MATLABâ€™s ODE solver ODE 45.</p>

<p>The approximated 1D wave equation model is an attempt to describe vocal fold motion via the 1D wave equation. This model assumes the edges of the vocal folds move like a 1D vibrating string or membrane. In this model, the 1D wave equation is solved via dâ€™Alambertâ€™s solution to the 1D wave equation using the finite difference method.   This model presents a decent approximation of the motion and may be a valuable approximation for fast simulation of vocal fold motion.

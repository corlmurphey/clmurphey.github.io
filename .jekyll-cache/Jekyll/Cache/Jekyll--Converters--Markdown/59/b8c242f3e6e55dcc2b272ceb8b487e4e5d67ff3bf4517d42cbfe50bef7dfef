I"3<p>I am an incoming PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado - Boulder. My advisors are <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/">Liz Bradley</a> and <a href="https://jedbrown.org/">Jed Brown</a>.</p>

<p>In a semi-recent past life, I worked as a mechanical engineer and registered U.S. patent agent. Specializing in thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and manufacturing, I wrote and prosecuted over 100 patent applications on a broad range of hardware and software technologies. Some of my other projects include numerous computational models simulating biomechanical growth and remodeling, cardiac electrical pacing, combustion engines, and cogeneration plants.</p>

<p>In my free time, I am an active church musician, recovering competitive swimmer, amateur bike builder, and proud Golden Retriever parent.</p>

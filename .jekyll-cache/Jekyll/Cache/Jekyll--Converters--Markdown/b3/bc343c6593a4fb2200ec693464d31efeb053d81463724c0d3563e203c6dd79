<p>I worked with Alexander Zoellner and Professor Ellen Kuhl developed a continuum mechanics model of skin growth to predict the rate at which skin grows when stretched. For children born with large birthmarks, removal of the birthmarks involves implanting an inflatable saline balloon subdermally in order to stretch and grow  skin surrounding the birthmark so that the birthmark can be excised and the excised area can be covered with the new skin. When skin is stretched, the load on the skin causes cells to multiply and, thus, the skin to grow. Thus, a computational model of skin growth can be instrumental in determining what size implants should be used to grow a particular area of skin and how much time it takes to grow the particular area of skin.</p>

<p>The skin growth project was a continuation of a class project (ME 239, Spring 2012) on red blood cell growth and optical tweezing.  The paper for this project can be found on the right.</p>

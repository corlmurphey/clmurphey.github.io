<p>As the first engineer at Nebia, I was responsible for Research and Development of the Nebia Shower System, which uses 70% less water than the average shower while providing a radically different and immersive showering experience. Using computational fluid dynamics and other computational methods, I designed fluid pathways and nozzle layouts that limited heat lost from the showerâ€™s water droplets due to evaporative cooling and heat transfer from the small droplets emitted from the shower.</p>

<p>During my time at Nebia, I contributed to the design and fluid mechanics of over 16 different prototypes. After eighteen months from our initial prototype, we shipped our first mass-produced units to customers.</p>

<p>Additional information about my work at Nebia can be found at:
Nebiaâ€™s Kickstarter Campaign,which I helped write and contributed to the simulation graphics throughout.</p>

<p>An ANSYS interview and article in which I discuss how simulation helped design the Nebia shower. This highlights the thermomechanical design approach we used at Nebia.</p>

<p>Nebiaâ€™s Issued Utility Patents:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On nozzle selection and arrangement. I designed DoEs to select an array of nozzles for the Nebia shower and arrange said nozzles in a configuration that limited heat dissipation and provided sufficient water pressure for rinsing out debris. The findings from these DoEs were the basis of this patent.</li>
  <li>On fluid pathways, which I designed and tested. I designed and prototyped various fluid pathways that 1) fit into Nebiaâ€™s head enclosure; 2) enabled the fluid in the showerhead to develop sufficiently prior to entry into each nozzles so that the nozzles performed consistently; and 3) limited turbulence and cavitation within the showerhead.</li>

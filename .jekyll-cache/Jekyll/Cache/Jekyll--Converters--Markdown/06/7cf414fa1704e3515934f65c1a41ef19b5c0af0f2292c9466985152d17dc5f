<p>As the first engineer at Nebia, I was responsible for Research and Development of the Nebia Shower System, which uses 70% less water than the average shower while providing a radically different and immersive showering experience. Using computational fluid dynamics and other computational methods, I designed fluid pathways and nozzle layouts that limited heat lost from the shower’s water droplets due to evaporative cooling and heat transfer from the small droplets emitted from the shower.</p>

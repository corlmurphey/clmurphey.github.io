&lt;p&gt;I worked with Professor Ellen Kuhl on computational models of the heart, skin, red blood cells, and vocal folds.  In this project, I developed a model of biventricular contraction and electrical conduction due to stimulation by pacemaker electrodes, implanted in the walls of both ventricles. Through this model, we were able to simulate EKGs representing electrical conductance of the myocardium viewed from  different planes of the heart.  The projections that simulate the EKG data are depicted on the right; pacing locations can be found to the left. (You can find the resulting conference paper below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voltage-conductance&quot;&gt;Voltage Conductance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can visualize propagation of electrochemical voltages through the myocardium. Using a tetrahedral mesh of a healthy human heart with 3129 nodes and 11347 elements, a computational model based on the two- parameter Aliev-Panfilov excitation model was used to simulate the propagating depolarization and repolarization of the myocardium, with voltages φ between -80 and +20 mV [2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resulting-ekgs&quot;&gt;Resulting EKGs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate virtual ECG images, we project the heart vector onto six predefined lead vectors that mimic the six frontal leads of electrocardiogram electrodes within the plane of the person’s chest. Each of the six electrocardiogram leads displays a characteristic temporal evolution in voltage in the ventricular myocardium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;atomization&quot;&gt;Atomization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first engineer at Nebia, I was responsible for Research and Development of the Nebia Shower System, which uses 70% less water than the average shower while providing a radically different and immersive showering experience. Using computational fluid dynamics and other computational methods, I designed fluid pathways and nozzle layouts that limited heat lost from the shower’s water droplets due to evaporative cooling and heat transfer from the small droplets emitted from the shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at Nebia, I contributed to the design and fluid mechanics of over 16 different prototypes. After eighteen months from our initial prototype, we shipped our first mass-produced units to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;additional-information&quot;&gt;Additional Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information about my work at Nebia can be found at:
Nebia’s Kickstarter Campaign,which I helped write and contributed to the simulation graphics throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ANSYS interview and article in which I discuss how simulation helped design the Nebia shower. This highlights the thermomechanical design approach we used at Nebia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nebia’s Issued Utility Patents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On nozzle selection and arrangement. I designed DoEs to select an array of nozzles for the Nebia shower and arrange said nozzles in a configuration that limited heat dissipation and provided sufficient water pressure for rinsing out debris. The findings from these DoEs were the basis of this patent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On fluid pathways, which I designed and tested. I designed and prototyped various fluid pathways that 1) fit into Nebia’s head enclosure; 2) enabled the fluid in the showerhead to develop sufficiently prior to entry into each nozzles so that the nozzles performed consistently; and 3) limited turbulence and cavitation within the showerhead.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with Alexander Zoellner and Professor Ellen Kuhl developed a continuum mechanics model of skin growth to predict the rate at which skin grows when stretched. For children born with large birthmarks, removal of the birthmarks involves implanting an inflatable saline balloon subdermally in order to stretch and grow  skin surrounding the birthmark so that the birthmark can be excised and the excised area can be covered with the new skin. When skin is stretched, the load on the skin causes cells to multiply and, thus, the skin to grow. Thus, a computational model of skin growth can be instrumental in determining what size implants should be used to grow a particular area of skin and how much time it takes to grow the particular area of skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skin growth project was a continuation of a class project (ME 239, Spring 2012) on red blood cell growth and optical tweezing.  The paper for this project can be found on the right.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Corey Lynn Murphey</name></author><category term="skin" /><category term="sim" /><summary type="html">CFD simulations of spray and atomization of a showerhead</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Vocal Fold Vibration</title><link href="/posts/vf" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vocal Fold Vibration" /><published>2021-05-05T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-05-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>/posts/blog-post-vocal</id><content type="html" xml:base="/posts/vf">&lt;h1 id=&quot;vocal-folds&quot;&gt;Vocal Folds&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;growth&quot;&gt;Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a classical singer, vocal polyp growth is a frightening yet all too real risk of my hobby. Vocal polyps grow when the vocal folds beat as a result of extensive abuse of the vocal folds, such as by yelling, singing, or talking loudly and for extending periods of time. I developed a model of vocal polyp growth, predicting the magnitude of forces and duration of time required to cause initial polyp growth. Once a polyp begins to grow, polyps grow exponentially due to larger surface area interfering with the natural motion of the vocal folds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vibration&quot;&gt;Vibration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later I revisited vocal fold modeling to look at vocal fold motion. For this project, I studied 1-dimensional motion of the vocal folds in the transverse plane of the larynx. Building on existing models that examine motion in the frontal plane of the body, this model provides a different perspective on vocal fold motion crucial for building patient-specific diagnostic tool.  The Symmetric and Asymmetric Motion videos below are described by 1D equations of motion and solved by MATLAB’s ODE solver ODE 45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approximated 1D wave equation model is an attempt to describe vocal fold motion via the 1D wave equation. This model assumes the edges of the vocal folds move like a 1D vibrating string or membrane. In this model, the 1D wave equation is solved via d’Alambert’s solution to the 1D wave equation using the finite difference method.   This model presents a decent approximation of the motion and may be a valuable approximation for fast simulation of vocal fold motion.

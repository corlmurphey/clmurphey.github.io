I am an incoming PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado - Boulder. I am co-advised by Liz Bradley (https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/) and Jed Brown (https://jedbrown.org/).

In a semi-recent past life, I was a Stanford-trained mechanical engineer and registered U.S. patent agent.  

In my free time, I am an active church musician, cantor, and amateur pianist.  As a former competitive swimmer, I also enjoy swimming in open water, riding the cyclocross bike I built from scratch, and running on whatever trails I can find. My favorite past-time is playing and hiking with my beloved Golden Retrievers, Siggi Stardust and Bailey.

## Research Interests
- Numerical methods & scientific computing
- Linear and non-linear PDEs
- Fluid mechanics and acoustics
- Sustainable design

## Overview
- M.S. Mechanical Engineering, Stanford '14
- B.S.  Mechanical Engineering, Stanford '12

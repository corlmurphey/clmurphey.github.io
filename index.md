I am an incoming PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado - Boulder. I am co-advised by Liz Bradley and Jed.

In a past life, I was a Stanford-trained mechanical engineer and patent agent with a penchant for tackling complex problems.  

Specializing in thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and manufacturing, I have written and prosecuted over 100 patent applications on a broad range of hardware and software technologies including manufacturing systems, medical devices, and consumer electronics. I have also developed numerous computational models simulating biomechanical growth and remodeling, cardiac electrical pacing, combustion engines, and cogeneration plants.
In my free time, I am an active church musician, cantor, and amateur pianist.  As a former competitive swimmer, I also enjoys swimming in open water, riding the cyclocross bike I built from scratch, and running on whatever trails I can find. My favorite past-time is playing and hiking with my beloved Golden Retrievers, Siggi Stardust and Bailey.
